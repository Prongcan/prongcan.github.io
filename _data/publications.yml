  abstract: "Through attention analysis, we identify specific <strong>Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads</strong> — a <em>sparse, dynamic</em> set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning. We propose <strong>VERA</strong>, a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty to trigger explicit verbalization of visual evidence. VERA achieves <strong>21.3%</strong> relative improvement on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and <strong>20.1%</strong> on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks."

  title: "ExpInstructor: An Agentic AI Instructor for Experience-Driven Idea Evaluation"

  abstract: "We propose <strong>ExpInstructor</strong>, the first agentic AI instructor that emulates how human mentors leverage past scholarly experience to guide research ideation. ExpInstructor extracts experience triples from large-scale review corpora, constructs an Experience Graph, and employs an agentic reasoning framework for experience-driven idea evaluation. Both model-based and human assessments demonstrate that ExpInstructor significantly outperforms existing baselines."
